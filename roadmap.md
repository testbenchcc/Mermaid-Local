# Mermaid-Local Roadmap

This file tracks medium- and long-term goals for the project.

## Short-term
- Stabilize node connection tools (Connect New Node / Connect Existing Node). *(Initial pass implemented: modals now expose full configuration for nodes and links with live preview.)*
- Improve node selection and highlighting across all nodes.
- Expand right-click context menu with additional PLC-related node shapes and types.

## Longer-term
- Polish UI/UX for editing larger diagrams.
- Add additional diagram templates and examples.
